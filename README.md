# assignment_two_dev_academy
In this repo, there are two files, assignment_three.ipynb and assignment_four.ipynb. 
assignment_three.ipynb prompts the user for a series of inputs such as a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then,
once all the information has been inputted, the program takes that data and place it into a premade story. 
To create this program, I used the print function to welcome the user to the game and to explain the instructions. I also used the input function to prompt the user to enter the inputs (noun, adjective etc). I used a while loop to ensure that the user could quit at any time. Honestly, this was the part that tricked me out, as I initially didn't write the whileloop properly. I used an f string to piece the story altogether and the print function to print the final story for the user.
assignment_four is called Lost in Lagos, which is a simple text-based adventure game. I had to relate the game to my hometown in order for me to understand how to create the game properly. Players navigate through key locations in Lagos, with the goal of reaching Banana Island.  The game uses Python concepts such as dictionaires, strings, variables, input/output, if/else statements, print functions, and integers.
